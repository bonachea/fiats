# Summary
[Fiats](https://go.lbl.gov/fiats) provides a platform for research on the training and deployment of neural-network surrogate models for computational science.
Fiats also supports exploring, advancing, and combining functional, object-oriented, and parallel programming patterns in Fortran 2023 [@fortran2023].
As such, the Fiats name has dual expansions: "Functional Inference And Training for Surrogates" or "Fortran Inference And Training for Science."
Fiats inference and training procedures are `pure` and therefore satisfy a language constraint imposed on procedure invocations inside Fortran's parallel loop construct: `do concurrent`.
Furthermore, the Fiats training procedures are built around a `do concurrent` parallel reduction.
Several compilers can automatically parallelize `do concurrent` on Central Processing Units (CPUs) or Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
Fiats thus aims to achieve performance portability through standard language mechanisms.

In addition to an `example` subdirectory with illustrative codes, the Fiats `demo/app` subdirectory contains three demonstration applications:

1. One trains a cloud-microphysics surrogate for the Berkeley Lab [fork](https://go.lbl.gov/icar) of the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research (ICAR) model.
2. Another calculates input- and output-tensor statistics for ICAR's physics-based microphysics models.
3. A third performs batch inference using an aerosols surrogate for the Energy Exascale Earth Systems Model ([E3SM](https://e3sm.org)).

Ongoing research explores how Fiats can exploit multi-image execution, a set of Fortran features for Single-Program, Multiple-Data (SPMD) parallel programming with a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) [@numrich2018co-arrays], where the PGAS features center around "coarray" distributed data structures.

To explore how new language features and novel uses of longstanding features can power deep learning, Fiats contributors work to advance Fortran by

* Participating in the Fortran standardization process and
* Contributing to compiler development through
  - Writing unit tests [@rasmussen2022agile],
  - Studying performance [@rouson2025automatically],
  - Isolating and reporting compiler bugs and fixing front-end bugs,
  - Publishing and updating the Parallel Runtime Interface for Fortran (PRIF) [@bonachea2024prif; @prif-0.5], and
  - Developing the first PRIF implementation: [Caffeine](https://go.lbl.gov/caffeine) [@rouson2022caffeine; @bonachea2025caffeine].

Fiats thus facilitates studying deep learning for science and studying programming paradigms and patterns for deep learning in Fortran 2023.

# Statement of need
Fortran 2008 introduced two forms of parallelism: `do concurrent` for loop-level parallelism and multi-image execution for SPMD/PGAS parallelism in shared or distributed memory.
Fortran 2018 and 2023 expanded and refined these features by adding, for example,

1. `Do concurrent` iteration locality specifiers, including reductions and
2. Collective subroutines, image teams, events (semaphores), atomic subroutines, and more,

which creates a need for libraries and frameworks that support users who adopt these features.
For example, one requirement impacting library design stems from the aforementioned language constraint allowing only side-effect-free (`pure`) procedure invocations inside `do concurrent`.

All intrinsic functions defined in the Fortran 2023 standard are `simple`, an attribute that implies `pure` plus additional constraints.
Libraries that export `pure` procedures thus behave like extensions of the language.
To wit, the Fortran 2023 standard states: "It is expected that most library procedures will conform to the constraints required of pure procedures, and so can be declared pure and referenced in `do concurrent` constructs... and within user-defined `pure` procedures."

Conversely, multi-image execution in a library places a requirement on the client code.
The Fortran standard defines steps for synchronized image launch, synchronized normal termination, and single-image initiation of global error termination.
Multi-image execution in a library thus requires support for multi-image execution in the main program.

A surrogate model's utility hinges upon inference calculations executing faster than the physics-based model the surrogate replaces.
This commonly restricts the surrogate neural network to a few thousand tunable parameters.
For networks of modest size, useful insights can sometimes be gleaned from visually inspecting the network parameters.
Fiats therefore stores networks in human-readable JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
The Fiats companion package [Nexport](https://go.lbl.gov/nexport) exports Fiats JSON files [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).

# State of the field
At least six open-source software packages provide deep learning services to Fortran.
Three provide Fortran application programming interfaces (APIs) that wrap C++ libraries:

* [Fortran-TF-Lib](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/fortran-tf-lib) is a Fortran API for [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org),
* [FTorch](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch) [@Atkinson-FTorch] is a Fortran API for libtorch, the PyTorch back-end, and
* [TorchFort](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TorchFort) is also a Fortran API for libtorch.

As of this writing, recursive searches in the root directories of the these three projects find no `pure` procedures.
Procedures are `pure` if declared as such or if declared `simple` or if declared `elemental` without the `impure` attribute.
Because any procedure invoked within a `pure` procedure must also be `pure`, the absence of `pure` procedures precludes the use of these APIs anywhere in the call stack inside a `do concurrent` construct.
Also, as APIs backed by C++ libraries, none use Fortran's multi-image execution features.

Three packages supporting deep learning in Fortran are themselves written in Fortran:

* [Athena](https://github.com/nedtaylor/athena) [@taylor2024athena]
* [Fiats](https://go.lbl.gov/fiats) [@rouson2025automatically]
* [neural-fortran](https://github.com/modern-fortran/neural-fortran) [@curcic2019parallel]

Searching the Athena, Fiats, and neural-fortran `src` subdirectories finds that over half of the procedures in each are `pure`, including 75\% of Fiats procedures.
Included in these tallies are procedures explicitly marked as `pure` along with `simple` procedures and `elemental` procedures without the `impure` attribute.
Athena, Fiats, and neural-fortran each employ `do concurrent` extensively.
Only Fiats, however, leverages the locality specifiers introduced in Fortran 2018 and expanded in Fortran 2023 to include parallel reductions.

Of the APIs and libraries discussed here, only neural-fortran and Fiats use multi-image features: neural-fortran in its core library and Fiats in a demonstration application.
Both use multi-image features minimally, leaving considerable room for researching parallelization strategies.

Each of the Fortran deep learning APIs and libraries discussed in this paper is actively developed except Fortran-TF-Lib.
Fortran-TF-Lib's most recent commit was in 2023 and no releases have been posted.
The other mentioned projects have most-recent commits no older than two months as of June 2025.

# Recent research and scholarly publications
Fiats supports research in training surrogate models and parallelizing batch inference calculations for atmospheric sciences.
This research has generated two peer-reviewed paper submissions: one accepted to appear in workshop proceedings [@rouson2025automatically] and one in open review [@rouson2025cloud].  
Four programs in the Fiats repository played significant roles in these two papers:

1. [`example/concurrent-inferences.f90`](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/fiats/blob/joss-line-references/example/concurrent-inferences.f90),
2. [`example/learn-saturated-mixing-ratio.f90`](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/fiats/blob/joss-line-references/example/learn-saturated-mixing-ratio.F90),
3. [`app/demo/infer-aerosols.f90`](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/fiats/blob/joss-line-references/demo/app/infer-aerosol.f90#L1), and
4. [`app/demo/train-cloud-microphysics.f90`](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/fiats/blob/joss-line-references/demo/app/train-cloud-microphysics.F90).

@rouson2025automatically used program 1 to study automatically parallelizing batch inferences via `do concurrent`.
@rouson2025cloud used programs 2--4 to study neural-network training for cloud microphysics and inference for atmospheric aerosols.
The derived types in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram in \autoref{fig:derived-types} enabled these studies.

![Class diagram: derived types (named in bordered white boxes), type relationships (connecting lines), type extension (open triangles), composition (solid diamonds), or directional relationship (arrows).  Read relationships as sentences wherein the type named at the base of an arrow is the subject followed by an annotation (in an unbordered gray box) followed by the type named at the arrow's head as the object.  Type extension reads with the type adjacent to the open triangle as the subject.  Composition reads with the type adjacent to the closed diamond as the subject. \label{fig:derived-types}](class-overview){ width=100% }

![String class diagram \label{fig:string_t}](string_t){ width=50% }

![File class diagram \label{fig:file_t}](file_t){ width=35% }

![Neural network class diagram \label{fig:neural_network_t}](neural_network_t){ width=70% }

\autoref{fig:derived-types} includes two of the [Julienne](https://go.lbl.gov/julienne) correctness-checking framework's derived types, `string_t` and `file_t`.
These are included because other parts of the figure reference these types.
The rightmost four types in \autoref{fig:derived-types} exist primarily to support inference.
The leftmost six support training.
Because inference is considerably simpler, it makes sense to describe the right side of the diagram before the left side.

The `concurrent-inferences` example program performs batch inference using the `string_t`, `file_t`, and `neural_network_t` types.
\autoref{fig:string_t} through \autoref{fig:neural_network_t} show class diagrams with more details on these types.
Each detailed diagram displays a top panel listing the type name, an empty middle panel with private components omitted, and a bottom panel listing public procedure bindings.

The bottom panel also lists what the Fortran 2023 standard describes as user-defined structure constructors, which are generic interfaces through which to invoke functions that define a result of the named type [@fortran2023]. 
We henceforth refer to these as "constructors."
From the bottom of the class hierarchy in \autoref{fig:derived-types}, the `concurrent-inferences` program does the following:

![Tensor class diagram \label{fig:tensor_t}](tensor_t){ width=60% }

![Unmapped network class diagram \label{fig:unmapped_network_t}](unmapped_network_t){ width=100% }

![Double precision file class diagram \label{fig:double_precision_file_t}](double_precision_file_t){ width=80% }

1. Gets a `character` file name from the command line,
2. Passes the name to a `string_t` constructor,
3. Passes the resulting `string_t` object to a `file_t` constructor, and
4. Passes the resulting `file_t` object to a `neural_network_t` constructor.

The program then repeatedly invokes the `infer` type-bound procedure on a three-dimensional (3D) array of `tensor_t` objects (see \autoref{fig:tensor_t}) using OpenMP directives or `do concurrent` or an array statement.
The array statement takes advantage of `infer` being `elemental`.
Line [101](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/fiats/blob/joss-line-references/example/concurrent-inferences.f90#L101) of `example/concurrent-inferences.f90` at `git` tag `joss-line-references` demonstrates neural-network construction from a file.
Line [109](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/fiats/blob/joss-line-references/example/concurrent-inferences.f90#L109) demonstrates using the network for inference.

The `infer-aerosols` program performs inferences by invoking `double precision` versions of the `infer` generic binding on an object of type `unmapped_network_t` (see \autoref{fig:unmapped_network_t}), a parameterized derived type (PDT) that has a `kind` type parameter.
To match the expected behavior of the aerosol model, which was trained in PyTorch, the `unmapped_network_t` implementation ensures the use of raw network input and output tensors without the normalizations and remappings that are performed by default for a `neural_network_t` object.
The `double_precision_file_t` (see \autoref{fig:double_precision_file_t}) type controls the interpretation of the JSON network file: JSON does not distinguish between categories of numerical values such as `real`, `double precision`, or even `integer`, so something external to the file must determine the interpretation of the numbers in a JSON file.

![Trainable network class diagram \label{fig:trainable_network_t}](trainable_network_t){ width=100% }

![Training configuration class diagram \label{fig:training_configuration_t}](training_configuration_t){ width=80% }

![Mini-batch class diagram \label{fig:mini_batch_t}](mini_batch_t){ width=80% }

The `learn-saturated-mixing-ratio` and `train-cloud-microphysics` programs focus on using a `trainable_network_t` object (see \autoref{fig:trainable_network_t}) for training.
The former trains neural network surrogates for a thermodynamic function from ICAR: the saturated mixing ratio, a scalar function of temperature and pressure.
The latter trains surrogates for the complete cloud microphysics models in ICAR -- models implemented in thousands of lines of code.
Whereas diagrammed relationships of `neural_network_t` reflect direct dependencies of only two types (`file_t` and `tensor_t`), even describing the basic behaviors of `trainable_network_t` requires showing dependencies on five types:

* A `training_configuration_t` object (see \autoref{fig:training_configuration_t}), which holds hyperparameters such as the learning rate and choice of optimization algorithms,
* A `file_t` object from which the `training_configuration` is read inside the `trainable_network_t` constructor,
* A `mini_batch_t` object (see \autoref{fig:mini_batch_t}) that stores an array of `input_output_pair` objects (see \autoref{fig:input_output_pair_t}) from the training data set,
* Two `tensor_map_t` objects (see \autoref{fig:tensor_map_t}) storing the linear functions that map inputs to the training data range and map outputs from the training data range back to the application range, and
* A parent `neural_network_t` object storing the network architecture, including weights, biases, layer widths, etc.

![Tensor map class diagram \label{fig:tensor_map_t}](tensor_map_t){ width=100% }

The `trainable_network_t` type stores a `workspace_t` (not shown) as a scratch-pad for training purposes.
The workspace is not needed for inference.
During each training step, a `trainable_network_t` object passes its `workspace_t` to a `learn` procedure binding (not shown) on its parent `neural_network_t`.
Lines [388--396](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/fiats/blob/joss-line-references/demo/app/train-cloud-microphysics.F90#L388-L396) of `demo/app/train-cloud-microphysics.f90` at `git` tag `joss-line-references` demonstrate:

1. A loop over epochs,
2. The shuffling of the `input_output_pair_t` objects at the beginning of each epoch,
3. The grouping of `input_output_pair_t` objects into `mini_batch_t` objects, and
4. The invocation of the `train` procedure for each mini-batch,

where steps 2 and 3 express deep learning's stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
